Future plans include expanding to Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks.


# MNIST Deep Learning Models

This repository is dedicated to exploring and implementing various deep learning models for the task of classifying handwritten digits from the widely-used **MNIST dataset**. It currently features **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**, demonstrating their strong performance in image classification tasks.

The project will expand to include other powerful architectures, specifically:
* **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs):** Investigating their application to sequential processing of image data.
* **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Networks:** A specialized type of RNN, LSTMs will be used to explore their capabilities in handling dependencies within image sequences.

This collection aims to serve as a practical resource for understanding how different neural network designs perform on a classic dataset. Each model implementation will be provided in an accessible format, typically Jupyter notebooks, allowing for easy experimentation and learning of deep learning concepts.

## Project Contents

Currently, this repository contains the implementation of a CNN model for MNIST classification. Key steps covered include:

* **Importing Libraries:** Essential libraries like TensorFlow, Keras, NumPy, Matplotlib, scikit-learn, and Seaborn are imported.
* **Data Loading and Preprocessing:** The MNIST dataset is loaded, pixel values are normalized, and images are reshaped to fit the CNN input format.
* **Model Definition:** A Sequential CNN model is defined with Conv2D, MaxPooling2D, Flatten, and Dense layers.
* **Model Compilation:** The model is compiled using the 'adam' optimizer and 'sparse_categorical_crossentropy' loss function, with 'accuracy' as a metric.
* **Model Training:** The model is trained on the preprocessed training data for 5 epochs with a validation split of 0.1.
* **Model Evaluation:** The trained model's performance is evaluated on the test data, and the test accuracy is printed.
* **Prediction:** The model is used to predict labels for the test dataset.
* **Classification Report:** A classification report (Precision, Recall, F1-score) is generated to provide detailed performance metrics.
* **Confusion Matrix:** A heatmap of the confusion matrix is plotted to visualize the model's predictions versus actual labels.
* **Accuracy Plot:** Training and validation accuracy over epochs are plotted to visualize the model's learning progress.

## Getting Started

To run the notebooks in this repository, you can use Google Colaboratory (recommended for GPU access and zero setup) or a local Python environment.

### Using Google Colab (Recommended)

1.  Open the `.ipynb` files directly in Google Colab.
2.  Colab provides a free, cloud-based environment with pre-installed libraries and optional GPU/TPU access.

### Using a Local Environment

1.  Clone this repository:
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/YourUsername/mnist-deep-learning.git](https://github.com/YourUsername/mnist-deep-learning.git) # Or your chosen repo name
    cd mnist-deep-learning
    ```
2.  (Optional) Create a virtual environment:
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate # On Windows: `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```
3.  Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install tensorflow numpy matplotlib scikit-learn seaborn
    ```
    *(A `requirements.txt` file can be added later for larger projects.)*
4.  Launch Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```
5.  Open and run the `.ipynb` files.
